# ConnectMeGUI (beta)

A password testing application for Wi-Fi networks on Windows systems. In this beta version, you must manually enter your file with passwords to be tested. In the next version, a custom dictionary feature will be added where you can input data that will automatically generate a more specific password dictionary for your target.
